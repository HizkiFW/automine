# automine
Minesweeper X solver made with Python 2 (Windows only)

## How to use
- Install pywin32 (`pip install pypiwin32`)
- Clone/download repo
- Open up Minesweeper X and set the skin to `automine.bmp`
- Edit `automine.py` to match number of tiles
- `python automine.py`

Currently the only way to stop the script is by pressing `Ctrl-Alt-Del`. The script will fail to move the mouse and throw an error, which will terminate the loop.
